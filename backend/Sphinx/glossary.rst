    ISO 8601
        An international standard date/time format. The platform produces and expects ISO 8601 time stamps in the following format:

        ``YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS[.ssssss]`` [``Z``, ``+00:00``, or time zone]

        Examples:

        - ``2015-07-01T12:31:45Z``
        - ``2015-07-01T12:31:45.987654+00:00``

        The platform normally provides any date and time information in UTC (the worldwide reference time zone, also known as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT, and abbreviated as ``Z``). When no time zone is given, UTC is intended.
