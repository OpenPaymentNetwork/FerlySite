Hi ${owner_name},

<p>Did you just try to add this email address
(<strong>${contact_email}</strong>) to another
${site_title} account?  <strong>${contact_name}</strong>
is trying to add this email address, but they can not add it
to their account as long as it is connected with your account.</p>

<p>If this was not you, you can safely ignore this email.</p>
